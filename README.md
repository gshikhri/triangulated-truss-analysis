## triangulated-truss-analysis: Identify and label DNA origami based triangulated trusses from Electron microscopy images

DNA Origami based triangulated trusses [reported here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00381)

Their bio-physical properties can be investigated from the electron micrographs. That would require using computer vision algorithms to identify (segment) individual structures from a wide field of view. This is here achieved using a combination of traditional computer vision algorithms:
- Adaptive thresholding
- Mathematical morphology 
- Structure identification using ridge detectors 
- Labelling individual structures

So far the algorithms can correctly segment trusses (some false positives when two trusses are touching). In future, I would like to implement RandomForest based pixel classifier for more robust segmentation.
